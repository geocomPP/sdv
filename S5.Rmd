Conclusions
=====================

There are an almost infinite number of different combinations colours, adornments and line widths that could be applied to a map (or any other data visualisation) so do not feel constrained by the examples presented in this chapter. Take inspiration from maps and graphics you have seen and liked, and experiment. The process is iterative, probably taking multiple attempts to get right. Show your map to friends and peers for feedback before you publish them or use them in a report. To give your maps a final polish you may wish to export them as a pdf using `ggsave` function and then add additional customisations using graphics package such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. 

The beauty of producing maps in a programming environment as opposed to the GUI offered by the majority of GIS programs lies in the fact that each line of code can be easily adapted to a different purpose. Users can create a series of scripts that act as templates and simply call them when required. This can save time in the long run and has the added advantage that all outputs will have a consistent style. 

This chapter has covered a variety of techniques for the preparation and and visualisation of spatial data in R. While this is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of R's spatial capabilities, the simple worked examples lay the foundations for further exploration of spatial data in R, using the multitude of spatial data packages available. These can be discovered online, through R's internal help (we recommend frequent use of R queries such as `?plot`) and other book chapters on the subject. It is hoped that the techniques and examples covered in this chapter will help communicate the results of spatial data analysis to the target audience in a compelling and effective way, without the need for the repetitive "pointing and clicking" described in the chapter's opening quote. As the R community grows, so will its range of applications and available packages. The supportive online communities surrounding large open source programs such as R are one of their greatest assets, so we recommend you become an active "open source" citizen rather than merely a passive consumer of new software (Ramsey & Dubovsky, 2013). As R continues to grow as a spatial analysis and data visualisation plaform, the opprtunities to benefit from it by creating compelling maps are only set to grow.
