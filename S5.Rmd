Conclusions
=====================

There are an almost infinite number of different combinations colours, adornments and line widths that could be applied to a map, so take inspiration from maps and graphics you have seen and liked. The process is an iterative one, it will take multiple attempts to get right. Show your map to friends and colleagues - all will have an opinion but don’t be afraid to stand by the decisions you have taken. To give your maps a final polish you may wish to export them as a pdf using the `ggsave()` function and importing them into a vector graphics package such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. 

The beauty of producing maps in a programming environment as opposed to the GUI offered by the majority of GIS software packages lies in the fact that each line of code can be easily adapted to a different dataset. Users can therefore create a series of scripts that act as templates and simply call them when required. This saves a huge amount of time and has the added advantage that all outputs will have a consistent style and thus offer more professional looking publications. 

This chapter has covered a large number of techniques and approaches for the preparation, analysis and visualisation of spatial data in R. Whilst it  only covers the tip of the iceberg in terms of R's capabilities, it does lay the foundations to the use of the multitude of other spatial data packages available. These can be discovered online and through the help documentation and other chapters provided by the R community. By utilising the data visualisation techniques and examples of best practice we have covered it is hoped that you will be able to communicate your results in a compelling and effective way without the need for the repetitive "pointing and clicking" required of many GIS packages; you can now tweak colours and other aspects of the plots without the need to start from scratch each time an iterative improvement is required. As the R community grows so will its range of applications and available packages so there will be many exciting opportunities ahead to improve on what is presented here.
