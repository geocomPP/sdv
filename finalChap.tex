\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is R?}

R is a free and open source computer program for
processing data. It runs on all major operating systems and
relies primarily on the \emph{command line} for
data input. This means that instead of interacting with the program by
clicking on different parts of the screen via a \emph{graphical user
interface} (GUI), users type commands for the operations they wish to
complete. For new users this might seem a little daunting at first, however the approach has a
number of benefits, as highlighted by Gary Sherman (2008, p.~283),
developer of the popular Geographical Information System (GIS) QGIS:

\begin{quote}
With the advent of ``modern'' GIS software, most people have become accustomed to menu driven by point and click operations. That's good, but there is a tremendous
amount of flexibility and power waiting for you with the command line.
Many times you can do something on the command line in a fraction of the
time you can do it with a GUI.
\end{quote}

A key benefit is that commands sent to R
can be stored and repeated from scripts, thus facilitating transparent and reproducible research by
removing the need for both software licenses and encouraging
documentation of code. Furthermore, access to R's source code and the provision of a framework for extensions
has enabled many programmers to improve on the basic, or "base", R functionality. As a result, there are now more
than 4000 official add-on \emph{packages}, allowing R to tackle
almost any numerical problem. If there is a useful function that R
cannot currently perform, it is likely that someone is working
on a solution. One area where
extension of R's basic capabilities have been particularly successful in
recent years is the addition of a wide variety of spatial analysis and
visualisation tools (Bivand et al. 2013). The latter will be the focus
of this chapter.

\subsection{Why R for spatial data visualisation?}

R was conceived - and is still primarily known - for its capabilities as
a ``statistical programming language'' (Bivand and Gebhardt 2000).
Statistical analysis functions remain core to the package, but there is
broadening functionality to reflect a growing user base across
disciplines. It has become ``an integrated suite of software facilities
for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display'' (Venables et
al. 2013). Spatial data analysis and visualisation is an important
growth area within this increased functionality. The map of Facebook
friendships produced by Paul Butler, for example, is iconic in this
regard and has reached a global audience (Figure 1). This shows linkages
between friends as lines pass across the curved surface of the Earth (using
the \texttt{geosphere} package). The secret to the success of this map
was the time taken to select the appropriate colour palette, line widths
and transparency for the plot. As we discuss in Section 3, the importance
of such details cannot be overstated. They can be the difference between
a stunning graphic and an impenetrable chart.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figure/butler_facebook_2.jpg}
\caption{Iconic plot of Facebook friendship networks worldwide, by Paul
Butler}
\end{figure}

Arguably this map helped inspire the R community to produce more ambitious
graphics, a process fuelled by an increased demand for data visualisation
and the development of packages that augment R's preinstalled `base
graphics'. Thus R has become a key tool for analysis and visualisation
used by the likes of Twitter, the New York Times and Google. Thousands
of consultants, design houses and journalists also rely on R - it is no
longer merely the preserve of academic research and many graduate jobs
now list R as a desirable skill.

Finally, it is worth noting that there are a few key differences between R and
traditional desktop GIS software. While dedicated GIS programs
handle spatial data by default and display the results in a single way,
there are various options in R that must be decided by the user (for
example whether to use R's base graphics or a dedicated graphics package
such as ggplot2). Indeed, it is this flexibility, illustrated by the
custom map of shipping routes presented later in this chapter, that makes R
an attractive visualisation solution. 

All of the
results presented in this chapter can be reproduced (and modified) by typing
the short code snippets that are presented into R. Elsewhere in this book,
these principles are extended in the context of reproducible geographic
information science ***(TODO: reference Chris Brunsden's Chapter)***.

\section{A practical primer on spatial data in R}

This section introduces those steps required to get started with processing spatial data in R. The focuses of the chapter is on the visualisation of so-calleed vector data (common in socio-economic examples), however, R also provides functionality for the analysis and visualisation of raster data (see supporting materials). As with the rest of the chapter,  a practical element is embedded, including R code that can be run on your own computer. For users
completely new to R, we would recommend beginning with an introductory
type tutorial, such as Torf and Brauer (2012) or ``Introduction to Visualising Spatial Data in R'' (Lovelace and
Cheshire 2014). Both are available free online.

The first stage is to obtain and load the data used for the examples into R. These data have been uploaded into an online repository that also provides a detailed tutorial to accompany this Chapter:
\href{https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/blob/master/sdv-tutorial.pdf?raw=true}{github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR}.
Upon visiting this page you will see many files. One of these is
`sdv-tutorial.pdf', which offers a comprehensive introductory tutorial -
we recommend new R users refer to this as accompaniment to the
chapter.\footnote{To
% ***Put in Footnote from here**** 
download the data that will allow the examples to be reproduced, click
on the ``\href{https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/archive/master.zip}{Download ZIP}''
button on the right hand side of the 
\href{https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/}{page}, 
and unzip this to a
convenient place on your computer (for example, the Desktop). This should
result in a folder called `sdvwR-master' being created.}

In any data analysis project, spatial or otherwise, it is important to
have a strong understanding of the dataset before progressing. R is able to import a very wide range of spatial data formats by linking with the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). An interface to this library
is contained in the \texttt{rgdal} package: install and load it by by
entering \texttt{install.packages("rgdal")} followed by
\texttt{library(rgdal)}, on separate lines. The former only needs to be
typed once to install the package, however, the latter must be
run for each new R session that requires use of the functions contained within the package.

The world map that we use is available from the Natural Earth website and a
slightly modified version of it (entitled ``world'') is loaded using the
following code. \footnote{ A common problem preventing the data being loaded
correctly is that R is not set with the correct working directory.
For more information, please refer online:
\href{https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/blob/master/sdv-tutorial.pdf?raw=true}{tutorial}
if this is an issue.}

\end{Shaded}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{figure/A_Basic_Map_of_the_World.png}
\caption{A Basic Map of the World}
\end{figure}

The above block of code loads the rgdal library, creates and then plots, in Figure 2, a new
\emph{object} called \texttt{wrld}. This operation should be fast on most computers because
\texttt{wrld} has quite a small file size. Spatial data can however get very large as the number and complexity of zones increases. It can therefore be useful to keep track of the size of spatial objects and to
simplify them when necessary prior to visualisation \footnote{R makes this easy, and is described in Section
2 of the
\href{https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/blob/master/sdv-tutorial.pdf?raw=true}{tutorial}
that accompanies this Chapter.
}.

When spatial data are imported into R, they are saved in a
\texttt{spatial} object class using the \texttt{sp} package (Bivand et al.
2013). The spatial data are divided into a series of different
\emph{slots}, storing the attribute and geometry data separately \footnote{For more detail on this
topic, see ``The structure of spatial data in R'' in the online
tutorial.}. To view the slot names of an object you can use the function slotNames(), with the object name written within the brackets.

The contents of ``slots'' within spatial data objects can be accessed using the ``\texttt{@}'' symbol. In the example below, the first two rows of the data slot are displayed, and can be treated as a standard data frame.

\section{Fundamentals of Spatial Data Visualisation}

Good maps can have an enormous impact on understanding of spatial patterns, 
from initial exploratory data analysis, through to communicating of results.
Graphics do, however, need to be refined and calibrated, and this section describes
such considerations. It should be
noted that not all good maps and graphics must
contain all the features discussed: they should be seen as suggestions
rather than firm principles.

Effective map making is a difficult process, as Krygier and Wood (2011)
put it: ``there is a lot to see, think about, and do'' (p6). We use \emph{ggplot2} as the package of choice to produce most of the
maps presented in this chapter because it easily facilitates good
practice in data visualisation. The ``gg'' in its name stands for
``Grammar of Graphics'', a set of rules developed by Wilkinson (2005).
Grammar in the context of graphics works in much the same way as it does
in language: providing structure to the presented material. The
ggplot2 package was developed by Hadley Wickham, and includes a syntax for
building graphics in layers using the \texttt{+} symbol (see Wickham,
2010). This layering component is especially useful in the context of
spatial data since it is conceptually the same as map layers in a
conventional GIS.

In the following analysis, the previously loaded map of the world will be used to
demonstrate a series of cartographic principles. This spatial object contains 35
columns of data, however, for our purposes, we are only really interested
in population \texttt{("pop\_est")}. Typing
\texttt{summary(wrld\$pop\_est)} provides basic descriptive statistics
on population.

Before progressing, we will reproject the data \footnote{For more information on referencing systems, see the links in the supporting materials}.
The coordinate reference system of the wrld
shapefile is WGS84, which is a very common latitude and longitude
format. Without projecting the data when plotted this format distorts
the size of countries close to the North and South poles (at the top and
bottom of the above plot). Instead, the
Robinson projection (see Figure 3) can be used to provide a better compromise between areal distortion
and shape preservation. Changes of projection can be accomplished using the spTransform(), with the projection required set with the CRS (coordinate reference system) parameter. 
There are many different projections which can be set by adjusting to a different CRS value. 

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figure/The_Robinson_Projection.png}
\caption{The Robinson Projection}
\end{figure}

Plotting the reprojected spatial object results in a world map that is much better proportioned, and as such, when 
adding detail to the representation, salient patterns will be presented more clearly to end users. The
plots created in the examples thus far use R's base graphics capabilities. However, the remaining examples will use the ggplot2
package introduced above. This requires the data to be in a slightly different format to base R and should be converted using the \texttt{fortify} function. This step discards the attribute data associated with the spatial object and so this needs to be reattached using the \texttt{merge} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{wrld.rob.f <- }\KeywordTok{fortify}\NormalTok{(wrld.rob, }\DataTypeTok{region =} \StringTok{"sov_a3"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}

\CommentTok{# Use by.x and by.y arguments to specify the columns that match the two}
\CommentTok{# dataframes together:}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now that the R object is in the correct format to be plotted with ggplot2, the code that follows
 produces a choropleth map coloured by the population variable. This
demonstrates the syntax of ggplot2 by first linking together a series
of plot commands, and assigning them to a single R object called
\texttt{map}. If you type \texttt{map} into the command line, R will
then execute the code and generate the plot shown in Figure 4. By specifying the
\texttt{fill} variable within the \texttt{aes()} (short for
`aesthetics') argument, ggplot2 colours the countries using a default
colour palette and automatically generates a legend.
\texttt{geom\_polygon()} tells ggplot2 to plot polygons. As will be
shown later, these defaults can be easily altered to change
a map's appearance.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{map <- }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(wrld.pop.f, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(long, lat, }\DataTypeTok{group =} \NormalTok{group, }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \NormalTok{pop_est)) + }\KeywordTok{geom_polygon}\NormalTok{() + }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\caption{World Population Map}
\end{figure}

Colour has an enormous impact on how people will perceive a graphic.
Adjusting a colour palette from yellow to red or from green to blue, for
example, can alter the readers' response. In addition, the use of colour
to highlight particular regions or de-emphasise others are important
tricks in cartography that shouldn't be overlooked. For more
information about the importance of different features of a map for its
interpretation, see Monmonier (1996).

ggplot2 recognises the difference between continuous and categorical
(nominal) variables and will automatically assign an appropriate colour
palette accordingly (see Figure 5). The default colour palettes are a
good place to start, but users can specify them, for example, if they needed to print a  map in black and white. The
\texttt{scale\_fill\_} family of commands enable such customisation. For
categorical data, \texttt{scale\_fill\_manual()} can be used (see Figure 5).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Produce a map of continents}
\NormalTok{map.cont <- }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(wrld.pop.f, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(long, lat, }\DataTypeTok{group =} \NormalTok{group, }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \NormalTok{continent)) + }
    \KeywordTok{geom_polygon}\NormalTok{() + }\KeywordTok{coord_equal}\NormalTok{() + }\KeywordTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \StringTok{"Longitude"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{y =} \StringTok{"Latitude"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"World Continents"}\NormalTok{) + }

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figure/A_Map_of_the_Continents_Using_Default_Colours.png}
\caption{A Map of the Continents Using Default Colours}
\end{figure}

Colours can be specified manually, either using words, as illustrated in the example, or more flexibly, such as through the use of hexadecimal colour codes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{map.cont + }\KeywordTok{scale_fill_manual}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{values =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"yellow"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"red"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"purple"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{, }
    \StringTok{"orange"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"blue"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"green"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"black"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The command \texttt{scale\_fill\_continuous()} is used to set
a continuum-based colour scheme:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Note the use of the 'map' object created earler}
\NormalTok{map + }\KeywordTok{scale_fill_continuous}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{low =} \StringTok{"white"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{high =} \StringTok{"black"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Choosing an appropriate colour palette is difficult and there are a variety of considerations such as the intended destination of a graphic (computer screen, print etc), the likely audience and the visual impairments such as colour blindness. There is a large body of literature associated with colour perception and this forms the basis to the \emph{Color Brewer} palettes developed
by Cynthia Brewer (see http://colorbrewer2.org). These are designed to
be colour blind safe and perceptually uniform such that no one colour
jumps out more than any others. This latter characteristic is important
when trying to produce impartial maps. R has a package that contains these
colour palettes and they can be easily accessed by ggplot2.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(RColorBrewer)}
\CommentTok{# note the use of the scale_fill_gradientn() function rather than}
\CommentTok{# scale_fill_continuous() used above}
\NormalTok{map + }\KeywordTok{scale_fill_gradientn}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{colours =} \KeywordTok{brewer.pal}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"YlGn"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In addition to altering the colour pallete used to represent a continuous
dataset, it may also be desirable to adjust the breaks at which the colour
transitions occur. There are many ways to select both the optimum number
of breaks and the locations in the dataset at
which they occur. This is important for the comprehension of a graphic
since it alters the colours associated with each value. The
\texttt{classINT} package contains many ways to automatically create
these breaks. We use the \texttt{grid.arrange} function from the
gridExtra package to display a series of maps side by side,  illustrating different break choices.

Line colour and width are also important parameters for enhancing the legibility of a graphic (see Figure 6). The code below demonstrates it
is possible to adjust these using the \texttt{colour} and \texttt{lwd}
arguments. The impact of different line widths will vary depending on screen size and resolution. Also, if you save the plot to pdf (e.g.~using
the \texttt{ggsave} command), this will also alter the relative line widths. As such, it is often useful to generate and check plots in the desired output format, and then adjust the code until these
are appropriate.

There are other parameters, such as layer transparency (use the
\texttt{alpha} parameter for this), that can be applied to all aspects of
the plot - both points, lines and polygons. Space does not permit full
exploration here, but more information is available in the ggplot2
package documentation (see \href{http://ggplot2.org/}{ggplot2.org}).

They include grids (also known as graticules), orientation arrows, scale
bars and data attribution. Not all are required on a single map, indeed
it is often best that they are used sparingly to avoid unnecessary
clutter (Monkhouse and Wilkinson 1971). With ggplot2, scales and legends
are provided by default, but they can be customised.

The maps created so far have concerned a single dataset, however, it is possible to layer
separate datasets together to create a single representation. This first requires an empty plot, meaning that each new layer must be defined with
its own dataset, and as such, adjust the syntax a little from that presented previously. Although more code is needed, this does enable
much greater flexibility with regards to what can be included as new
layer content. Another possibility is to use \texttt{geom\_segment()}
to add a rudimentary arrow (see \texttt{?geom\_segment} for
refinements):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

% \subsubsection{Scale bar}

ggplot2's scale bar capabilities are perhaps the least advanced element
of the package. This approach will only work if the spatial data are in
a projected coordinate system to ensure there are no distortions as a
result of the curvature of the earth. In the case of the world map the
distances at the equator in terms of degrees east to west are very
different from those further north or south. Any line drawn using the
the simple approach below would therefore be inaccurate. For maps
covering large areas - such as the entire world - leaving the axis
labels on will enable them to act as a graticule to indicate distance.
As such, the following example uses a shapefile pertaining to London's
Boroughs.

\begin{Shaded}

\subsubsection{Legends}

Legends are added automatically, but can be customised in a number of
ways. They are an important adornment of any map since they describe
what attributes the colours reference. As a general rule, legends with values that go to a large number of significant figures should be avoided. The following code moves the legend from the default position to the top of the map.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

Many more options are available, such as adding a title, adjusting the font size or colour, and controlling other aspects such as the map borders. These are illustrated by the following code.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Title}
\NormalTok{map + }\KeywordTok{theme}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{legend.title =} \KeywordTok{element_text}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{colour =} \StringTok{"Red"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{size =} \DecValTok{16}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{face =} \StringTok{"bold"}\NormalTok{))}

\subsection{Plotting over a base map}

The ggmap package extends the ggplot2 package to integrate online mapping services such as Google Maps and OpenStreetMap (OSM) for base
cartography. By using image tiles derived from these services, spatial data can be placed
in context as users can easily orientate themselves to streets and
landmarks. In the following examples, data on London sports participation is used. The data
were originally projected in British National Grid (BNG) which pertains to a different referencing system
than that used in the Google or OSM  online map services. This is a common problem and one that is easily overcome using the reprojection function outlined above.

After importing the boundary data and reprojecting, a bounding box of the
\texttt{lnd.wgs84} object was calculated to identify the geographic extent of the map.
This information is used to request an appropriate base map from a selected
map tile service. The first block of code in the snippet below retrieves the
bounding box and then adds 5\% so there is a little space around the edges of the data to be plotted.
This is then fed into the \texttt{get\_map} function as the location
parameter. The code actually utlises two nested functions, \texttt{ggmap} and \texttt{get\_map} which are required to produce the plot and provides the base map data. You will notice from the code snippet below that \texttt{ggmap} follows the same syntax structures as ggplot2 and so can
easily be integrated with the other examples included here. The example data object contains spatial polygons but spatial points and lines can also be plotted.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
The resulting map looks reasonable, but it would be improved with a
simpler base map. A design firm called \emph{stamen}
provide the tiles we need and they can be brought into the plot with the
\texttt{get\_map} function. This produces a much clearer map and enables readers to focus on the data rather than the cartography of the base map. The integration of data and services from third parties is a growing trend within R and one of its key strengths: users are not constrained to proprietary or paid for services, they can make full use of the open data sources that are now available.

\section{Case Study}
As an illustrative example, this final section describes the creation of a map depicting 18th Century shipping flows. The data used in this visualisation have been obtained from the Climatological Database for the World's Oceans (CLIWOC) and
represent a sample of digitised ships' logs from the 18th Century.
We are using a very small sample of the the full dataset, which is
available
from\\\href{http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/cliwoc/}{pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/cliwoc/}.
The example has been chosen to demonstrate a range of plotting capabilities
within ggplot2, and illustrate those ways in which they can be applied to produce
high-quality maps that are reproducible with only a few lines of code.

The example uses the png package to load in a series of map
annotations stored at png graphics files. These have been created in image editing software and will add a historic feel to the map. We are also loading in a World boundary
shapefile and the shipping data itself.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(rgdal)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(ggplot2)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(png)}
\NormalTok{wrld <- }\KeywordTok{readOGR}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"ne_110m_admin_0_countries"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{btitle <- }\KeywordTok{readPNG}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"figure/brit_titles.png"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{compass <- }\KeywordTok{readPNG}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"figure/windrose.png"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{bdata <- }\KeywordTok{read.csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/british_shipping_example.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The first few lines in the \texttt{bdata} object contain seven columns, with each row reporting a single point on the
ship's course. The first step is to specify the format for a number of plot parameters that will remove the axis labels.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{xquiet <- }\KeywordTok{scale_x_continuous}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{""}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{breaks =} \OtherTok{NULL}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{yquiet <- }\KeywordTok{scale_y_continuous}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{""}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{breaks =} \OtherTok{NULL}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{quiet <- }\KeywordTok{list}\NormalTok{(xquiet, yquiet)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The next step is to prepare the World coastlines for input into ggplot2 with the \texttt{fortify}  command, and then combined with background data to create the plot. In the following code, this sets the extents of the plot window and provides a
blank canvas on which layers can be built. The first layer
created is the wrld object; the code is wrapped in \texttt{c()} to
prevent it from executing by simply storing it as the plot's parameters.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{wrld.f <- }\KeywordTok{fortify}\NormalTok{(wrld, }\DataTypeTok{region =} \StringTok{"sov_a3"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{base <- }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(wrld.f, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \NormalTok{long, }\DataTypeTok{y =} \NormalTok{lat))}
\NormalTok{wrld <- }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{geom_polygon}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{group =} \NormalTok{group), }\DataTypeTok{size =} \FloatTok{0.1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{colour =} \StringTok{"black"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \StringTok{"#D6BF86"}\NormalTok{, }
    \DataTypeTok{data =} \NormalTok{wrld.f, }\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To see the result of this simply type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{base + wrld + }\KeywordTok{coord_fixed}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figure/World_Map.png}
\caption{World Map}
\end{figure}

The code snippet below creates the plot layer containing the the
shipping routes. The \texttt{geom\_path()} function is used to string
together the coordinates to form the routes. You can see within the
\texttt{aes()} that this specifies the long and lat, plus pasted
together the \texttt{trp} and \texttt{group.regroup} variables to
identify the unique paths.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{route <- }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{geom_path}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(long, lat, }\DataTypeTok{group =} \KeywordTok{paste}\NormalTok{(bdata$trp, bdata$group.regroup, }
    \DataTypeTok{sep =} \StringTok{"."}\NormalTok{)), }\DataTypeTok{colour =} \StringTok{"#0F3B5F"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{size =} \FloatTok{0.2}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{data =} \NormalTok{bdata, }\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }
    \DataTypeTok{lineend =} \StringTok{"round"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We now have all we need to generate the final plot, shown in Figure \ref{fship}, by building the
layers together with the \texttt{+} sign as shown in the code below. The
first 3 arguments are the plot layers, and the parameters within
\texttt{theme()} are changing the background colour to sea blue.
\texttt{annotation\_raster()} plots the png map adornments loaded in
earlier- this requires the bounding box of each image to be specified.
In this case we use latitude and longitude (in WGS84) and we can use
these parameters to change the png's position and also its size. The
final two arguments fix the aspect ratio of the plot and remove the axis
labels.

\begin{Shaded}

    \DataTypeTok{ymax =} \DecValTok{65}\NormalTok{) + }\KeywordTok{coord_equal}\NormalTok{() + quiet}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{figure/World_Shipping.png}
\caption{World Shipping} \label{fship}
\end{figure}

In the plot example we have chosen the colours carefully to give the
appearance of a historic map. An alternative approach could be to use a
satellite image as a base map. It is possible to use the
\texttt{readPNG} function to import NASA's ``Blue Marble'' image for
this purpose. Given that the route information is the same projection as
the image it is very straightforward to set the image extent to span
-180 to 180 degrees and -90 to 90 degrees and have it align with the
shipping data. Producing the plot is accomplished using the code below.
This offers a good example of where functionality designed without
spatial data in mind can be harnessed for the purposes of producing
interesting maps. Once you have produced the plot, alter the code to
recolour the shipping routes to make them appear more clearly against
the blue marble background.

\section{Conclusions}

There are an almost infinite number of different combinations colours,
adornments and line widths that could be applied to a map (or any other
data visualisation) so do not feel constrained by the examples presented
in this chapter. Take inspiration from maps and graphics you have seen
and liked, and experiment. The process is iterative, probably taking
multiple attempts to get right. To give your
maps a final polish you may wish to export them as a pdf using
\texttt{ggsave} function and then add additional customisations using
graphics package such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

The beauty of producing maps in a programming environment as opposed to
the GUI offered by the majority of GIS programs lies in the fact that
each line of code can be easily adapted to a different purpose. Users
can create a series of scripts that act as templates and simply call
them when required. This can save time in the long run and has the added
advantage that all outputs will have a consistent style.

This chapter has covered a variety of techniques for the preparation and
visualisation of spatial data in R. While this is only the tip of the
iceberg in terms of R's spatial capabilities, the simple worked examples
lay the foundations for further exploration of spatial data in R, using
the multitude of spatial data packages available. These can be
discovered online, through R's internal help (we recommend frequent use
of R queries such as \texttt{?plot}) and other book chapters on the
subject. It is hoped that the techniques and examples covered in this
chapter will help communicate the results of spatial data analysis to
the target audience in a compelling and effective way. As the R community grows, so will its range of
applications and available packages. The supportive online communities
surrounding large open source programs such as R are one of their
greatest assets, so we recommend you become an active ``open source''
citizen rather than merely a passive consumer of new software (Ramsey \&
Dubovsky, 2013). As R continues its ascent a as a spatial analysis and
data visualisation platform, the opportunities to benefit from it by
creating compelling maps are only set to grow.

\section{Supporting Materials}

R is a constantly evolving and as its user community grows the number of online resources is set to increase. 
This chapter has focussed on the use of vector data. For those who would like to use R for processing and visualising rasters, we would recommend this vignette: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf
This is a good tutorial plotting raster data with ggplot2: http://nrelscience.org/2013/05/30/this-is-how-i-did-it-mapping-in-r-with-ggplot2/

Map projections are a complex and important topic that we only touch on here. The following two web pages offer some further context and technical information:
\href{http://spatial.ly/2011/03/flattening-the-earth/}{spatial.ly/2011/03/flattening-the-earth/}
and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map\_projection}.


To stay abreast of current developments and tutorials in R we recommend:
