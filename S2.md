R and Spatial Data
==================

## Preliminaries

R has a unique syntax that is worth learning in basic terms before 
loading spatial data: to R spatial and non-spatial data are 
treated in the same way, although they have different underlying data structures. 

The first step is to ensure that you are in the correct working directory. 
Use `setwd` to select the correct folder. Assuming the folder has been downloaded
from GitHub and unpacked into the desktop on a Windows computer, you would type the
following:


```r
setwd("C:/Users/Uname/Desktop/sdvwR-master")
```


In RStudio, it is recommended to work from *script files*. To open a new
R script, click `File > New File` (see the 
[RStudio website](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/keyboard_shortcuts) for shortcuts.)
Try typing and running (by pressing `ctl-Enter` in an RStudio script)
the following calculations to see how R works and plot the result.


```r
t <- seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 0.1)
x <- sin(t) * exp(-0.2 * t)
plot(t, x)
```

R code consists of *functions*, usually proceeded by brackets (e.g. `seq`)
and *objects* (`d`, `t` and `x`). Each function contains *arguments*,
the names of which often do not need to be stated: the function `seq(0, 20, 0.1)`, for example,
would also work because `from`, `to` and `by` are the *default* arguments.
Knowing this is important as it can save typing. In this chapter, however, 
we generally spell out each of the argument names, for clarity. 

Note the use of the assignment arrow `<-` to create new objects. 
Objects are entities that can be called to by name in R 
and can be renamed through additional assignements (e.g `y <- x` if y seems 
a more appropriate name). This is an efficient way of referring to large data objects or sets of commands.

Spatial Data in R
-----------------

In any data analysis project, spatial or otherwise, it is important to
have a strong understanding of the dataset before progressing. This
section will therefore begin with a description of the input data. 
We will see how data can be loaded into R and exported
to other formats, before going into more detail about the underlying
structure of spatial data in R.

### Loading spatial data in R

In most situations, the starting point of a spatial analysis project is to
load in the datasets. These may originate from government
agencies, remote sensing devices or 'volunteered geographical
information' (Goodchild 2007). R is able to import a very wide range of spatial data formats thanks to
its interface with the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), which
is enabled by the package `rgdal`. Below we will install the rgdal package
using the function `install.packages` (this can be used to install any packages) and then load
data from two spatial data formats: GPS eXchange (`.gpx`) and ESRI's
Shapefile.

`readOGR` is in fact capable of loading dozens more file formats, so the
focus is on the *method* rather than the specific formats. 
Let's start with a `.gpx` file, a tracklog recording a bicycle
ride from Sheffield to Wakefield uploaded OpenStreetMap [3].


```r
install.packages("rgdal")
library(rgdal)  # load the gdal package
ogrListLayers(dsn = "data/gps-trace.gpx")
shf2lds <- readOGR(dsn = "data/gps-trace.gpx", layer = "tracks")  # load track
plot(shf2lds)
shf2lds.p <- readOGR(dsn = "data/gps-trace.gpx", layer = "track_points")  # load points
points(shf2lds.p[seq(1, 3000, 100), ])
```



```
## Error: plot.new has not been called yet
```

```
## Error: plot.new has not been called yet
```


In the code above we first used R to *download* a file from the internet, using the
function `download.file` (note this has been *commented out* using the `#` symbol). 
The two essential arguments of this function
are `url` (we could have typed `url =` before the link) and `destfile`,
the destination file. As with any function, more optional
arguments can be viewed by by typing `?download.file`.

When `rgdal` has successfully loaded, the next task is not to import the
file directly, but to find out which *layers* are available to import, 
with `ogrListLayers`. The output from this command tells us
that various layers are available, including `tracks` and
`track_points`. These are imported into R's *workspace* using `readOGR`. 

Finally, the basic
`plot` function is used to visualize the newly imported objects, ensuring
they make sense. In the second plot function (`points`), we 
add points for a subset of the object. There will be no axes in the plot;
to see how to add them, enter `?axis`

Try discovering more about the function by typing `?readOGR`.
The documentation explains that the `dsn =` argument is 
interpreted differently depending on the type of
file used. In the above example, the `dsn` was set to as the name of the file.
To load Shapefiles, by contrast, the *folder* containing the data is
used:


```r
lnd <- readOGR(dsn = "data/", "london_sport")
```


Here, the files reside in a folder entitled `data`, which is in
R's current working directory (you can check this using `getwd()`).
If the files were stored in the working directory, one would use
`dsn = "."` instead. Again, it may be wise to plot the data that
results, to ensure that it has worked correctly. Now that the data has
been loaded into R's own `sp` format, try interrogating and plotting it,
using functions such as `summary` and `plot`.

The london_sport file contains data pertaining to the percentage of 
people within each London Borough who regularly undertake 
physical activity and also the 2001 population of each borough. 

Both of the datasets we have loaded so far are relatively small. 
But spatial data can get very large indeed. It is thus useful to 
understand how 'large' the object you are dealing with is, and
know how to reduce unnecessary complexity in its *geometry* to 
make it more manageable to analyse, plot and store. Fortunately, 
R makes this easy, with the commands `object.size` and `gSimplify`.
For more information on these useful commands, readers are 
referred to an [on-line vignette](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/11962) 
based on the `lnd` and `shf2lds` objects
we have just loaded. For now, let us continue with an
even more important topic: how R 'sees' spatial data.

### The structure of spatial data in R

Spatial datasets in R are saved in their own format, defined as 
`Spatial...` classes within the `sp` package. For this reason, 
`sp` is the basic spatial package in R, upon which the others depend. 
Spatial classes range from the basic `Spatial` class to the complex
`SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`: the `Spatial` class contains only two required *slots* [5]:


```r
getSlots("Spatial")
```

```
##        bbox proj4string 
##    "matrix"       "CRS"
```


This tells us that `Spatial` objects must contain a bounding box (`bbox`) and 
a coordinate reference system (CRS) accessed via the function `proj4string`. 
Further details on these can be found by typing `?bbox` and `?proj4string`. 
All other spatial classes in R build on 
this foundation of a bounding box and a projection system (which 
is set automatically to `NA` if it is not known). However, more complex 
classes contain more slots, some of which are lists which contain additional 
lists. To find out the slots of `shf2lds.simple`, for example, we would first 
ascertain its class and then use the `getSlots` command:


```r
class(shf2lds.simple)  # identify the object's class
```

```
## Error: object 'shf2lds.simple' not found
```

```r
getSlots("SpatialLinesDataFrame")  # find the associated slots
```

```
##         data        lines         bbox  proj4string 
## "data.frame"       "list"     "matrix"        "CRS"
```


The same principles apply to all spatial classes including 
`Spatial* Points`, `Polygons` `Grids` and `Pixels`
as well as associated `*DataFrame` classes. For more information on 
this, see the `sp` documentation: `?Spatial`.

To flatten a `Spatial*` object in R, so it becomes a simple
data frame, the `fortify` function can be used (more on this later).
For most spatial data handling tasks the `Spatial*` object classes are idea, 
as illustrated below.

### Saving and exporting spatial objects

A typical R workflow involves loading the data, processing/analysing the data
and finally exporting the data in a new form. 
`writeOGR`, the 
logical counterpart of `readOGR` is ideal for this task. This is performed using
the following command (in this case we are exporting to an ESRI Shapefile):


```r
shf2lds.simple <- SpatialLinesDataFrame(shf2lds.simple, data.frame(row.names = "0", 
    a = 1))
```

```
## Error: object 'shf2lds.simple' not found
```

```r
writeOGR(shf2lds.simple, layer = "shf2lds", dsn = "data/", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
```

```
## Error: object 'shf2lds.simple' not found
```





In the above code, the object was first converted into a spatial dataframe class required
by the `writeOGR` command, before 
being exported as a shapefile entitled shf2lds. Unlike with `readOGR`, the driver must 
be specified, in this case with "ESRI Shapefile" [4]. The simplified GPS data are now available
to other GIS programs for further analysis. Alternatively, 
`save(shf2lds.simple, file = "data/shf2lds.RData")`
will save the object in R's own spatial data format.

### Attribute joins

London Boroughs are official administrative
zones so we can easily join a range of other datasets 
to the polygons in the `lnd` object. We will use the example 
of crime data to illustrate this data availability, which is 
stored in the `data` folder available from this project's github page.


```r
load("data/crimeAg.Rdata")  # load the crime dataset from an R dataset
```


After the dataset has been explored (e.g. using the `summary` and `head` functions)
to ensure compatibility, it can be joined to `lnd`. We will use the
the `join` function in the `plyr` package but the `merge` function 
could equally be used (remember to type `library(plyr)` if needed).




`join` requires all joining variables to have the 
same name, which has already been done [7].


```r
lnd@data <- join(lnd@data, crimeAg)
```


Take a look at the `lnd@data` object. You should 
see new variables added, meaning the attribute join 
was successful. 


## Summary

To summarise this section, we have learned how to 
perform the crucial tasks of loading and saving spatial datasets 
in R. This should have been surprisingly painless 
considering the dread surrounding some command-line programs 
(watch out for typos!). We have also taken a look inside R's representation 
of spatial data, learned how to manipulate these datasets 
with a simple attribute join. Much more complex procedures are 
possible, but for now we will move on to visualisation.
