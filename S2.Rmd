A practical primer on spatial data in R
==================

This section briefly introduces some of the key steps to get started with R. 
Like the rest of the chapter, it has a large *practical* element, 
including R code to run on your own computer. For users completely new 
to R, we recommend beginning with an `introduction to R' type tutorial, 
such as Torf and Brauer (2012) or the frequently updated tutorial "Introduction
to Visualising Spatial Data in R" (Lovelace and Cheshire 2014). Both 
are available free online.

The first stage 
is to obtain and load the data used in the examples. In this case, all the 
data has been uploaded to an on-line repository that provides 
a detailed tutorial to accompany this Chapter:
[github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR](https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/blob/master/sdv-tutorial.pdf?raw=true). 
Upon visiting this page you will see many files. One of these 
is 'sdv-tutorial.pdf', which offers a comprehensive introductory tutorial - we recommend new R users 
refer to this to accompany the chapter. To download the data
that will allow the examples to be reproduced, click on the "Download ZIP" 
button on the right, and unpack this to a sensible place
on your computer (for example, the Desktop). 
This should result in a folder called 'sdvwR-master' being created.
Explore this and try opening some of the files, 
especially those from the sub-folder entitled "data", the input datsets.

In any data analysis project, spatial or otherwise, it is important to
have a strong understanding of the dataset before progressing. 
We will see how data can be loaded into R (ready for the next section) and exported
to other formats.

## Loading spatial data in R

R is able to import a very wide range of spatial data formats thanks to
its interface with the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). 
The `rgdal` package makes this possible: install and 
load it by by entering `install.packages("rgdal")` followed by `library(rgdal)`, 
on separate lines. 
The former only needs to be typed once, as it saves the data from the internet. 
The latter must be typed for each new R session that requires the package.

The world map we use is available from the Natural Earth website and a
slightly modified version of it (entitled "world") is loaded using the following code.
A common problem preventing the data being loaded correctly is that 
R is not in the correct *working directory*. Please refer to the online 
[tutorial](https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/blob/master/sdv-tutorial.pdf?raw=true) if this is an issue.

```{r A Basic Map of the World, results='hide', fig.width = 8, fig.height= 5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rgdal) # load the package (needs to be installed)
wrld <- readOGR("data/", "world")
plot(wrld)
```

The above block of code loaded the rgdal library, created a new *object* called `wrld` and 
plotted this object to ensure it is as we expect.
This operation should be fast on most computers because `wrld` is quite small.
Spatial data can get very large indeed, however. 
It can therefore be useful to 
know the size spatial objects and simplify them when necessary.
R makes this easy, as described in Section 2 of the 
[tutorial](https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/blob/master/sdv-tutorial.pdf?raw=true) that accompanies this Chapter. 
For now, let us continue with an even more important topic: how R 'sees' spatial data.

## How R 'sees' spatial data

Spatial datasets in R are saved in their own format, defined as 
`Spatial` classes within the `sp` package (Bivand et al. 2013). This data class divides the 
spatial information into different *slots* so the attribute and geometry data
are stored separately. This makes handling spatial data in R efficient.
For more detail on this topic, see "The structure of spatial data in R" in 
the online tutorial. We will see in the next section that this complex data
structure can be simplified in R using the `fortify` function. 

For now, let us ask some basic questions about the `wrld` object, using 
functions that would apply to any spatial dataset in R, to gain an understanding
of what we have loaded. How many rows of attribute data are there? This query can be answered using `nrow`:

```{r}
nrow(wrld)
```

What do the first 2 rows and 5 columns of attribute data contain?
To answer this question, we need to refer to the `data` slot of the 
object using the `@` symbol and use square brackets to define the subset
of the data to be displayed. In R, the rows are always referred to before
the comma within the square brackets and the column numbers after. Try
playing with the following line of code, for example by removing the square
brackets entirely:

```{r}
wrld@data[1:2, 1:5] 
```

The output shows that the first country in the `wrld` object is Afganistan.
Now that we have a basic understanding of the attributes of the spatial dataset, 
and know where to look for more detailed information about spatial data in R via
the online tutorial, it is time to move on to the topic of visualisation.
