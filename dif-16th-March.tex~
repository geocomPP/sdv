\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is R?}

R is a free and open source computer program that runs on all major
operating systems. It relies primarily on the \emph{command line} for
data input. This means that instead of interacting with the program by
clicking on different parts of the screen via a \emph{graphical user
interface} (GUI), users type commands for the operations they wish to
complete. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This seems }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For new users this might seem }\DIFaddend a little daunting at first\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, however }\DIFaddend the approach has a
number of benefits, as highlighted by Gary Sherman (2008, p.~283),
developer of the popular Geographical Information System (GIS) QGIS:

\begin{quote}
With the advent of ``modern'' GIS software, most people \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{want to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have become accustomed to menu driven by }\DIFaddend point and click \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{their way through life}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{operations}\DIFaddend . That's good, but there is a tremendous
amount of flexibility and power waiting for you with the command line.
Many times you can do something on the command line in a fraction of the
time you can do it with a GUI.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \end{quote}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The joy of this, when you get accustomed to it, is that any command is
only ever a few keystrokes away, and the order of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{A key benefit is that }\DIFaddend commands sent to R
can be stored and repeated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in scripts, saving time in the long-term. In
addition, R facilitates truly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from scripts, thus facilitating }\DIFaddend transparent and reproducible research by
removing the need for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{expensive }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{both }\DIFaddend software licenses and encouraging
documentation of code. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It is possible for anyone with the R installed to reproduce all the steps used by others. With the RStudio program it is
even possible to include `live' Rcode in text documents.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{In R what the user inputs is the same as what R sees when it processes
the request. Access to R}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore, access to R}\DIFaddend 's source code and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{openness about how it works
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the provision of a framework for extension
}\DIFaddend has enabled many programmers to improve \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{R over time and add an
incredible number of extensionsto its capabilities}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on base R functionality by creating a wide variety of extensions}\DIFaddend . There are now more
than 4000 official add-on \emph{packages}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for R}\DIFdelend , allowing it to tackle
almost any numerical problem. If there is a useful function that R
cannot currently perform, there is a good chance that someone is working
on a solution that will become available at a later date. One area where
extension of R's basic capabilities \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend been particularly successful in
recent years is the addition of a wide variety of spatial analysis and
visualisation tools (Bivand et al. 2013). The latter will be the focus
of this chapter.

\subsection{Why R for spatial data visualisation?}

R was conceived - and is still primarily known - for its capabilities as
a ``statistical programming language'' (Bivand and Gebhardt 2000).
Statistical analysis functions remain core to the package\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend but there is a
broadening of functionality to reflect a growing user base across
disciplines. R has become ``an integrated suite of software facilities
for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display'' (Venables et
al. 2013). Spatial data analysis and visualisation is an important
growth area within this increased functionality. The map of Facebook
friendships produced by Paul Butler, for example, is iconic in this
regard and has reached a global audience (Figure 1). This shows linkages
between friends as lines \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pass }\DIFaddend across the curved surface of the Earth (using
the \texttt{geosphere} package). The secret to the success of this map
was the time taken to select the appropriate colour palette, line widths
and transparency for the plot. As we discuss in Section 3\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the importance
of such details cannot be overstated. They can be the difference between
a stunning graphic and an impenetrable mess.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figure/butler_facebook_2.jpg}
\caption{Iconic plot of Facebook friendship networks worldwide, by Paul
Butler}
\end{figure}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Arguably this }\DIFaddend map helped inspire the R community to produce more ambitious
graphics, a process fuelled by \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an }\DIFaddend increased demand for data visualisation
and the development of packages that augment R's preinstalled `base
graphics'. Thus R has become a key tool for analysis and visualisation
used by the likes of Twitter, the New York Times and Google. Thousands
of consultants, design houses and journalists also rely on R - it is no
longer merely the preserve of academic research and many graduate jobs
now list R as a desirable skill.

Finally, it is worth noting \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that there are }\DIFaddend a few key differences between R and
traditional \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{GIS software such as QGIS}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{desktop GIS software}\DIFaddend . While dedicated GIS programs
handle spatial data by default and display the results in a single way,
there are various options in R that must be decided by the user (for
example whether to use R's base graphics or a dedicated graphics package
such as ggplot2). Indeed, it is this flexibility, illustrated by the
custom map of shipping routes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in Section 4 of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{presented later in }\DIFaddend this chapter, that makes R
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{so attractive . Another benefit of R compared with traditional approaches
to GIS is that it facilitates }\emph{\DIFdel{transparency}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{of research, a feature
that we will be using to great effect in this chapter: all of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an attractive visualisation solution. 
}

\DIFadd{All of }\DIFaddend the
results presented in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the subsequent sections }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this chapter }\DIFaddend can be reproduced (and modified) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at home, as described in the next section}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by inputing the short code snippets that are presented into R. Elsewhere in this book, these principles are extended in the context of reproducible geographic information science (****CB Chapter****)}\DIFaddend .

\section{A practical primer on spatial data in R}

This section \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{briefly introduces some of the key steps }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{introduces those steps required }\DIFaddend to get started with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{R. Like the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{processing spatial data in R. The focuses of the chapter is on visualisation of vector data (common in socio-economic examples), however, R also provides functionality for the analysis and visualisation of raser data (See accompanying website). As with the }\DIFaddend rest of the chapter,  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it has a large }\emph{\DIFdel{practical}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{element }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a practical element is embedded}\DIFaddend , including R code \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that can be }\DIFaddend run on your own computer. For users
completely new to R, we \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{would however }\DIFaddend recommend beginning with an `introduction to R'
type tutorial, such as Torf and Brauer (2012) or the frequently updated
tutorial ``Introduction to Visualising Spatial Data in R'' (Lovelace and
Cheshire 2014). Both are available free online.

The first stage is to obtain and load the data used \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the examples . In
this case, all the data has been uploaded to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the examples into R. These data have been uploaded into }\DIFaddend an online repository that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also }\DIFaddend provides a detailed tutorial to accompany this Chapter:
\href{https://github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR/blob/master/sdv-tutorial.pdf?raw=true}{github.com/geocomPP/sdvwR}.
Upon visiting this page you will see many files. One of these is
`sdv-tutorial.pdf', which offers a comprehensive introductory tutorial -
we recommend new R users refer to this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to accompany }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as accompaniment to }\DIFaddend the chapter. To
download the data that will allow the examples to be reproduced, click
on the ``Download ZIP'' button on the right \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and unpack }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hand side of the page, and unzip }\DIFaddend this to a
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sensible }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{convenient }\DIFaddend place on your computer (for example, the Desktop). This should
result in a folder called `sdvwR-master' being created.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Explore this and
try opening some of the files, especially those from the sub-folder
entitled ``data'', the input datsets.
}\DIFdelend 

In any data analysis project, spatial or otherwise, it is important to
have a strong understanding of the dataset before progressing. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We will
see how data can be loaded into R (ready for the next section) and
exported to other formats.

\DIFdelend R is able to import a very wide range of spatial data formats \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{thanks to
its interface }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by linking }\DIFaddend with the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{An interface to this library
is contained in the }\DIFaddend \texttt{rgdal} package\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{makes this possible}\DIFdelend : install and load it by by
entering \texttt{install.packages("rgdal")} followed by
\texttt{library(rgdal)}, on separate lines. The former only needs to be
typed once \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as it saves the data from the internet. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to install the package, however, the }\DIFaddend latter must be
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{typed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{run }\DIFaddend for each new R session that requires \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{use of the functions contained within the }\DIFaddend package.

The world map \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend we use is available from the Natural Earth website and a
slightly modified version of it (entitled ``world'') is loaded using the
following code. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A common problem preventing the data being loaded

\section{Fundamentals of Spatial Data Visualisation}

Good maps \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{depend on sound analysis and }\DIFdelend can have an enormous impact on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the understanding and communication of results. Thanks to new data sources and programs such as R, it has never been easier to produce a
map. Spatial datasets are now available in unprecedented volumes and
tools for transforming them into compelling maps and graphics are
becoming increasingly sophisticated accessible. Data and software,
however, only offer the starting points of good spatial data
visualisation.
Graphics }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{understanding of spatial patterns, 
from initial exploratory data analysis, through to communicating of results.
Graphics do however }\DIFaddend need to be refined and calibrated\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to best
communicate the message contained in the data. This section describes
the features of a good map. Not }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and this section describes
those considerations that would typically be required when creating a map. It should be
noted that not }\DIFaddend all good maps and graphics \DIFdelbegin \emph{\DIFdel{must}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{must
}\DIFaddend contain all the features \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{below}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discussed}\DIFaddend : they should be seen as suggestions
rather than firm principles.

Effective map making is \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend difficult process, as Krygier and Wood (2011)
put it: ``there is a lot to see, think about, and do'' (p6). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Visualisation usually comes at the end of a period of data analysis and,
perhaps when the priority is to finish an assignment, is tempting to
rush. The beauty of R (and other scripting languages) is the ability to
save code and re-run it. Colours, map adornments and other parameters
can therefore be quickly applied, so it is worth spending time creating
a template script that adheres to best practice.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend We use \emph{ggplot2} as the package of choice to produce most of the
maps presented in this chapter because it easily facilitates good
practice in data visualisation. The ``gg'' in its name stands for
``Grammar of Graphics'', a set of rules developed by Wilkinson (2005).
Grammar in the context of graphics works in much the same way as it does
in language: \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it provides a structure . The structure is informed by both
human perception and also mathematics to ensure that the resulting
visualisations are technically sound and comprehensible. By creating
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{providing structure to the presented material. The
}\DIFaddend ggplot2 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Hadley Wickham implemented these rules, including }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{package was developed by Hadley Wickham, and includes }\DIFaddend a syntax for
building graphics in layers using the \texttt{+} symbol (see Wickham,
2010). This layering component is especially useful in the context of
spatial data since it is conceptually the same as map layers in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a
}\DIFaddend conventional GIS.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{First ensure that the necessary packages are installed and that R is in
the correct working directory. Then load the ggplot2 package used in
this section.

Adjusting a colour palette from yellow to red or from green to blue, for
example, can alter the readers' response. In addition, the use of colour

\subsection{Map Adornments and Annotations}

Map adornments and annotations orientate the viewer and provide context.
They include grids (also known as graticules), orientation arrows, scale
bars and data attribution. Not all are required on a single map, indeed
it is often best that they are used sparingly to avoid unnecessary
clutter (Monkhouse and Wilkinson 1971). With ggplot2\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend scales and legends
are provided by default, but they can be customised.

\DIFdel{.
The result of this is that all subsequent layers are expected to have
the same variables. But what if we want to add a new layer from a
completely different dataset, for example to add a north arrow? To do
this, we must not add any arguments to the }\texttt{\DIFdel{ggplot}} %DIFAUXCMD

\subsubsection{Scale bar}

ggplot2's scale bar capabilities are perhaps the least advanced element
of the package. This approach will only work if the spatial data are in
a projected coordinate system to ensure there are no distortions as a
result of the curvature of the earth. In the case of the world map the
distances at the equator in terms of degrees east to west are very
different from those further north or south. Any line drawn using the
the simple approach below would therefore be inaccurate. For maps
covering large areas - such as the entire world - leaving the axis
labels on will enable them to act as a graticule to indicate distance.

\subsubsection{Legends}

Legends are added automatically\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend but can be customised in a number of
ways. They are an important adornment of any map since they describe
what \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{its colours mean. Try to select colour breaks that are easy to
follow and avoid labeling the legend }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{attributes the colours reference. As a general rule, legends }\DIFaddend with values that go to a large number of significant figures \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{should be avoided. The following code moves the legend from the default position to the top of the map}\DIFaddend .
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A few examples of legend customisation
are included below by way of introduction, but there are many more
examples available in the ggplot2 documentation.

\DIFdel{For this example we use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In the following examples, }\DIFaddend data on London sports participation \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is used}\DIFaddend . The data
were originally projected \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend British National Grid (BNG) which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is not

\DIFdel{The first job is to calculate the bounding box (bb for short) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{After importing the boundary data and reprojecting, a bounding box }\DIFaddend of the
\texttt{lnd.wgs84} object \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was calculated }\DIFaddend to identify the geographic extent of the map.
This information is used to request \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the appropriate map tiles from the
map service of our choice - a process conceptually the same as the size
of your web browser or smartphone screen when using Google maps for
navigation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an appropriate basemap from a selected

\DIFaddend \texttt{ggmap} follows the same syntax structures as ggplot2 and so can
easily be integrated with the other examples included here. First
\texttt{fortify} the \texttt{lnd.wgs84} object and then merge with the
required attribute data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lnd.wgs84.f <- }\KeywordTok{fortify}\NormalTok{(lnd.wgs84, }\DataTypeTok{region =} \StringTok{"ons_label"}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
We can now overlay this on our base map using the
\texttt{geom\_polygon()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lnd.b1 + }\KeywordTok{geom_polygon}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =} \NormalTok{lnd.wgs84.f, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \NormalTok{long, }\DataTypeTok{y =} \NormalTok{lat, }\DataTypeTok{group =} \NormalTok{group, }
    \DataTypeTok{fill =} \NormalTok{Partic_Per), }\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
The resulting map looks reasonable, but it would be improved with a
simpler base map in black and white. A design firm called \emph{stamen}
provide the tiles we need and they can be brought into the plot with the
\texttt{get\_map} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lnd.b2 <- }\KeywordTok{ggmap}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{get_map}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{location =} \NormalTok{b, }\DataTypeTok{source =} \StringTok{"stamen"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{maptype =} \StringTok{"toner"}\NormalTok{, }
    \DataTypeTok{crop =} \NormalTok{T))  }\CommentTok{# note the addition of the maptype parameter.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
We can then produce the plot as before.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{lnd.b2 + }\KeywordTok{geom_polygon}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =} \NormalTok{lnd.wgs84.f, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \NormalTok{long, }\DataTypeTok{y =} \NormalTok{lat, }\DataTypeTok{group =} \NormalTok{group, }
    \DataTypeTok{fill =} \NormalTok{Partic_Per), }\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend This produces a much clearer map and enables readers to focus on the
data rather than the basemap. Spatial polygons are not the only data
types compatible with \texttt{ggmap} - you can use any plot type and set
of parameters available in \texttt{ggplot2}, making it an ideal
companion package for spatial data visualisation.

annotations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stored at png graphics files}\DIFaddend . These have been created in image editing software and will add a historic feel to the map. We are also loading in a World boundary

\texttt{annotation\_raster()} plots the png map adornments loaded in

In the plot example we have chosen the colours carefully to give the
appearance of a historic map. An alternative approach could be to use a
satellite image as a base map. It is possible to use the
\texttt{readPNG} function to import NASA's ``Blue Marble'' image for
this purpose. Given that the route information is the same projection as
the image it is very straightforward to set the image extent to span
-180 to 180 degrees and -90 to 90 degrees and have it align with the
shipping data. Producing the plot is accomplished using the code below.
This offers a good example of where functionality designed without
spatial data in mind can be harnessed for the purposes of producing
interesting maps. Once you have produced the plot, alter the code to
recolour the shipping routes to make them appear more clearly against
the blue marble background.

\section{Conclusions}

There are an almost infinite number of different combinations colours,
adornments and line widths that could be applied to a map (or any other
data visualisation) so do not feel constrained by the examples presented
in this chapter. Take inspiration from maps and graphics you have seen
and liked, and experiment. The process is iterative, probably taking
multiple attempts to get right. Show your map to friends and peers for
feedback before you publish them or use them in a report. To give your
maps a final polish you may wish to export them as a pdf using
\texttt{ggsave} function and then add additional customisations using
graphics package such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

The beauty of producing maps in a programming environment as opposed to
the GUI offered by the majority of GIS programs lies in the fact that
each line of code can be easily adapted to a different purpose. Users
can create a series of scripts that act as templates and simply call
them when required. This can save time in the long run and has the added
advantage that all outputs will have a consistent style.

This chapter has covered a variety of techniques for the preparation and
visualisation of spatial data in R. While this is only the tip of the
iceberg in terms of R's spatial capabilities, the simple worked examples
lay the foundations for further exploration of spatial data in R, using
the multitude of spatial data packages available. These can be
discovered online, through R's internal help (we recommend frequent use
of R queries such as \texttt{?plot}) and other book chapters on the
subject. It is hoped that the techniques and examples covered in this
chapter will help communicate the results of spatial data analysis to
the target audience in a compelling and effective way, without the need
for the repetitive ``pointing and clicking'' described in the chapter's
opening quote. As the R community grows, so will its range of
applications and available packages. The supportive online communities
surrounding large open source programs such as R are one of their
greatest assets, so we recommend you become an active ``open source''
citizen rather than merely a passive consumer of new software (Ramsey \&
Dubovsky, 2013). As R continues its ascent a as a spatial analysis and
data visualisation platform, the opportunities to benefit from it by
creating compelling maps are only set to grow.
