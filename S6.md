1. "What kind of a name is R?" common question. R's
    name originates from the creators of R, Ross Ihaka and Robert
    Gentleman. R is an open source implementation of the statistical
    programming language S, so its name is also a play on words that
    makes implicit reference to this.

2. R is notoriously difficult to search for on major search engines, as
    it is such a common letter with many other uses beyond the name of a
    statistical programming language. This should not be a deterrent, as
    R has a wealth of excellent online resources. To overcome the issue,
    you can either be more specific with the search term (e.g. "R
    spatial statistics") or use an R specific search engine such as
    [rseek.org](http://www.rseek.org/). You can also search of online
    help *from within R* using the command `RSiteSearch`. E.g.
    `RSiteSearch("spatial statistics")`. Experiment and see which you
    prefer!
